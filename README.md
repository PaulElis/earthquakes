> The main entry point for the test is `src/index.js`. To get rid of this prompt, comment out the `<Assignment />` component.

We will be grading your test based on:

### (30 Points) Matches the Design

<!-- You will be graded here based on how closely your Earthquake App matches the design. You start with the full 30 points, for each inconsistency we find, we will detract 5 points.

The mockups are in the `src/` folder as `Mockup.jpg` and `ExpandedMockup.jpg`. -->

### (30 Points) Quality & Documentation

<!-- You will be graded here based on your level of documentation/communication, as well as your test coverage.

Each requirement you test is worth 5 points. Clear code, explanation of thought and documentation will earn 10 points. -->

### (40 Points) Completed Requirements

Your app **must do the following**.

<!-- 1. **(4 points)** The app should use the `useEarthquakes` hook to get the earthquakes. --> -->

<!-- 2. **(6 points)** You can search the Earthquakes by **place**. Not by any other field. Doing so returns only sorted earthquakes that match the query. -->

<!-- 3. **(8 points)** The earthquakes should be sorted by **highest magnitude to lowest magnitude**. 

In the event of a tie, you should sort by **most recent to oldest**. -->

<!-- 4. **(6 points)** There should never be more than 20 results showing. Only the 20 highest sorted earthquakes at most should show at any given time. Pagination is not required. -->

<!-- 5. **(4 points)** Each earthquake should show the following columns exactly like this

| ID         | Time                  | Location                         | Magnitude | More      |
| ---------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| us2000ai1z | July 25, 2017 @ 19:23 | 228km SSW of Bengkulu, Indonesia | 5.3       | [Details] | -->
<!-- 
6.  **(8 points)** The details column should render a button that says details. Clicking on it should show you the longitude and latitude for the earthquake. -->

<!-- 7.  **(4 points)** The time column should be formatted as shown above. -->

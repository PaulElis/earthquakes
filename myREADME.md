# Note

I've found that tests for me did not run properly in Codesandbox. I worked locally which was able to resolve this issue.

To run locally I moved 'mockedEarthquakeData' and other assets within 'src' folder.

# Installation

To install use "npm install" in root folder.

# Motivation
This project is intended to fulfil requirements for a take home assignment from GetGuru. This project project demonstrates my abilities in technologies such as React.js, Javascript, CSS, HTML, React-Testing-Library, Jest, Material UI + Typescript.

Furthermore the project highlights my ability to design and architect features for an application according to requirements and mockups.

## Purpose

This application displays earthquake data in table format sorted by magnitude and in the event of a tie, by most recent. The user is also able to search for earthquakes based on location which is a string search on an 'earthquake.place'.

The search function returns earthquakes that are in 'earthquake.place' that include the geographic location only ie. => 'Alaska', 'Tres Picos, Mexico', 'San Pedro de Atacama' but NOT '112km NE', '28km S'.

### Takeaways

I was able to improve upon my Typescript knowledge which I find to be a skill I'd love to improve going forward. The type checking and movement of the industry towards TS makes this a logical skill to learn.

I also learned some more neat CSS tricks to match the mockup using Material UI and got another chance to work with Moment.js to format date/time.
